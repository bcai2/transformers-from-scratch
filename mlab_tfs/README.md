## Introduction

### What is this?

- It seems useful to gain a deeper understanding of transformers by building some key models "from scratch" in a library like PyTorch, especially if you want to do AI safety research on them.
- Redwood Research runs a [Machine Learning for Alignment Bootcamp (MLAB)](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/3ouxBRRzjxarTukMW/apply-to-the-second-iteration-of-the-ml-for-alignment) in which one week consists of building BERT and GPT-2 from scratch, fine tuning them, and exploring some interpretability and training techniques.
- This repository takes the code from [the original MLAB repository](https://github.com/redwoodresearch/mlab) and cleans it up to make it easier for others to do this independently. The key differences between this repo and the original repo are:
	- Removed almost all the content besides the days about building BERT and GPT-2.
	- Created a starter [student](./mlab_tfs/bert/bert_student.py) file that has all the class and function stubs for the parts you'd need to build a transformer but without the implementation.
	- Migrated the original tests into a proper [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) test suite and added several more unit tests for various functionality.
	- Added docstrings to document what each part should do and give hints for the trivial-but-annoying parts.
	- Implemented a new [solution](mlab_tfs/sample_solutions/bert_student_mukobi.py) file with all the new documentation to test that all the tests pass.
	- Various renaming and reorganizing of files to make the repo a bit cleaner.

### Status

- [BERT](./mlab_tfs/bert): Fully operational, tested, documented, and ready for you to build.
- [GPT-2](./mlab_tfs/gpt2): In progress, but I'm currently not prioritizing development on this.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+.
- Read about and use [the transformer architecture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b83_-eo9NEaKDKc9R3P5h5xkLImqMw8ADLmi__rkLo4/edit#heading=h.nlbz88ykqv3r).
- Learn how to use [Numpy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/).
- Recommended: Learn how to use [einops](http://einops.rocks/) and [einsum](https://rockt.github.io/2018/04/30/einsum).

### Installation

1. Create a virtual environment with venv or Anaconda and activate it if you like to work with virtual environments.
2. [Install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) with the appropriate configuration for your environment.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the other requirements for this repository.
4. Run `pip install -e .` to install the mlab_tfs package in an editable state. 

### Testing

This repo uses the built-in [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) framework for evaluating your code.  You have a few options for running the tests
1. `python -m unittest mlab_tfs.tests.test_bert`
2. `python ./mlab_tfs/tests/test_bert.py`
3. If using an IDE like Visual Studio Code with the Python extension, the unit tests should already be discovered and show up in the Testing pane.

Most of the tests are in the form
- "Randomly initialize the student class and the reference class (from PyTorch or a solution file) with the same seed, pass the same input through it, and see if we get the same output."

but there are also tests for
- "Are the student class' attributes of the correct types?"
- or "Did the student cheat by calling the function from PyTorch that they're supposed to be implementing?"
- and there's one test class at the end that consists of "Instantiate the whole student transformer model and reference transformer model, load in the real BERT/GPT-2 weights from HuggingFace Transformers, pass a sequence of input tokens through, and see if we get the same output logits."

### Implementing Transformers

Now that you know how to test your code, go implement some transformers!
- Go to [the BERT folder](./mlab_tfs/bert).
- Read the instructions in the README file there.
- Reimplement the stubbed BERT classes and functions and pass the tests.

Note: Only the BERT folder is fully tested and documented, but you can also try writing your own `gpt2_student.py` and integrating it into the testing framework (please make a pull request to share this with others!).

### Known issues
- GPT-2 needs a starter file, better documentation (including a readme), and unit tests
